    "* `kruskal()` — an implementation that runs in about $\\mathcal O(n^2)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate valid random **undirected weighted graphs** as adjacency matrices\n",
    "* Compute MSTs with two different algorithms and verify they match in weight\n",
    "* Design timing experiments that are fair, repeatable, and interpretable\n",
    "* Present results professionally: tables/plots + clear discussion + limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## What you are given\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the `MST` class exactly as shown in codebase below. Use it as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note:** the class accepts *any* diagonal sentinel for “no edge” (commonly `0`), and treats that same value elsewhere as “no edge” as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your tasks \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Write test code to generate graphs (adjacency matrices)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that generates **symmetric square matrices** representing **undirected graphs** with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **non-negative integer weights**\n",
    "* **no self-loops** (all diagonal entries must be the no-edge sentinel)\n",
    "* **symmetry** (`G[i][j] == G[j][i]`)\n",
    "* a **configurable density** (sparse vs dense), or at minimum a consistent rule for whether an edge exists\n",
    "* a consistent **no-edge sentinel** (use `0` unless you want to be adventurous)\n",
    "\n",
    "You must ensure your graphs are **connected.**. *(Hint: what would the adjacency matrix of a disconnected graph look like?)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverable:**\n",
    "`make_graph(n: int, density: float, max_w: int, seed: int) -> list[list[int]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you don’t want to use `density`, you can design your own parameterization—but you must still produce a range of “more edges” vs “fewer edges” graphs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) For each generated graph, compute MSTs using *both* techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test graph `G`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an `MST(G)` object\n",
    "2. Compute `T_b = mst.boruvka()`\n",
    "3. Compute `T_k = mst.kruskal()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then verify correctness in a way that actually means something. A good minimum bar:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute total weight of `T_b` and `T_k`\n",
    "* They should match (for connected graphs)\n",

    "* A correctness check that raises an error if weights differ\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Time the techniques for various graph sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "You must collect timing data for a range of `n` values. Pick a sequence that makes sense given that Borůvka here is ~O(n⁴). These are just examples below. Consider more/different sizes to showcase your testing/experimenting attitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50` (safer)\n",
    "* or `n = 25, 50, 75, 100` (spicier; might hurt)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each `n`, run **multiple trials** (minimum 5; better 10+ if it’s not too slow). Use the same input graph for both algorithms in each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing rules (read this twice):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don’t time graph generation together with MST computation unless you clearly separate it.\n",
    "* Use a high-resolution timer (ok to import `time`)\n",
    "* Keep everything else constant (same machine, same settings).\n",
    "* Report **mean** and **standard deviation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A results table with at least: `n`, `trials`, `avg_boruvka`, `avg_kruskal`, plus variability\n",
    "* At least one plot showing runtime vs `n` (two curves)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Analyze and discuss your findings professionally\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a short report (300-600 words) that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experimental setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * How graphs were generated (density, weight range, connectedness strategy)\n",

    "2. **Results**\n",

    "   * Plot(s)\n",
    "3. **Discussion**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Does observed growth resemble the expected complexity?\n",
    "   * Where does Borůvka become impractical?\n",
    "   * How does density affect each method (if you varied density)?\n",
    "4. **Threats to validity / limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Python overhead, caching effects, small n weirdness, etc.\n",
    "   * Adjacency matrix representation isn’t the best for Kruskal in the real world\n",
