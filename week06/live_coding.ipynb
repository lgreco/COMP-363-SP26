    "* [Greedy algorithms](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/04-greedy.pdf) (chapter 4) in Jeff Erikson's book. <br/>\n",
    "Huffman encoding is a good example of a greedy algorithm that happens to work. As we discussed, greedy algorithms rarely work by themselves. The strategy often requires some fortification in the form of dynamic programming. For now, we are grateful that this particular technique works.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Leo's [slide deck about Huffman encoding](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kSXEB7mzumoUm4pw7dhtxJxX7xckzjpUDyWlGfAxzAI/edit?usp=sharing). (Ignore slides 47 and higher; still working on them).\n",

    "\n",
    "* [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) is a variable length code based on frequency of symbols. Unlike Huffman, Morse is a prefixed code. (Wikipedia article).\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Ham radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio) is an endeavor where Morse code is used today. It is also a platform for experimentation at the boundary of electronics and computing today. (Wikipedia article)."
