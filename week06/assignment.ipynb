If such a symbol existed, for example, `0000`**`0`** or `0000`**`1`** it would mean that it's either a left or a right child of `H`.

    "In ASCII representation, each character has the same length: 8 bits. So the message above is 88 characters long beucase there are 11 characters in `HELLO WORLD`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morse code, on the other hand, assigns shorter representations to more frequent characters. For example, the most frequent letter in English, `E`, is represented by the shortest possible Morse code: a single dot `.`, the next most frequent T, as a single dash `-`, and so on. The message `HELLO WORLD` in Morse code is transmitted as\n",

    "One *big* question here is *how* to pass the Huffman tree in the decoding process? The obvious answer is to pass the root of the tree (and therefore the entire tree) as an argument to the appropriate method, together with the encoded message that we would like to decode. This works fine for illustrative demonstrations of encoding/decoding. However, if we wish to encode a message and transmit it over a network, it is not clear how to also transmit a binary tree. In such cases we'll need to [serialize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) the object. For now, we don't have to worry about serialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to assess the quantitative merits of the encoding. In our example of encoding `HELLO WORLD`, we went from 88 bits in plain ASCII to 32 bits of Huffman codes. That's nearly a 60% reduction in the space required for the message. **However,** it would take about 3,200 bytes to store the Huffman tree. In other words, we need an additional 25,600 bits to compress an 88 bit message down to 32 bits. That's not very efficient.\n",

    "Your code should include functionality that measures how many bits we save with the Huffman encoding, but also how many bits we need to store the Huffman tree. To measure how much memory is required for an object (such as the root of a tree, and therefore the tree itself), you'll need a tool like [`pympler.asizeof.asizeof`](https://pympler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).
